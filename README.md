this smart contract organises sale of tickets for any event 

play around with it on remix

an overview of functions 

deploy: while deploying it takes two arguments 1. price 2. total number of tickets 

after deploying 


1. priceToPay: put number of tickets you want to buy... it will return the total amount you have to pay
2. buyTicket: add the number of tickets you want to buy and add amount of ethers in value section. the value should be equal to priceToPay
3. initiateresale: if you own tickets you can resell then just add your resaleprice and number of tickets you want to sell.

   rest everything is pretty much obvious would love some feedback :)
